Stereo Obstacle Avoidance for MAV
===============
This repository provides obstacle avoidance module using stereo camera. It includes both code for on-board (hardware) module and simulation. 

In this project, Gazebo with ROS is used for simulation. However, it does not includes any Gazebo or model here.
The code apart from the obstacle avoidance module can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/JThanat/rotors_simulator) forked from [RotorS](https://github.com/JThanat/rotors_simulator).
